# Memory Bank Rules

## At the Start of Every Session

You MUST read ALL files in `/memory_bank/` before doing any work:

1. `brandAndPositioning.md` — positioning, tone, approved copy
2. `resumeSource.md` — canonical resume facts (do NOT invent)
3. `siteMapAndSections.md` — page structure, section order, nav
4. `projectsCatalog.md` — project details, architecture, security notes
5. `securityProof.md` — cybersecurity credibility, threat models, claims
6. `visualDesignSystem.md` — colors, typography, motion, accessibility
7. `assetsAndLinks.md` — URLs, placeholders, asset checklist
8. `activeContext.md` — current work, next steps, open questions
9. `progress.md` — done, in progress, blockers
10. `decisions.md` — architecture decision records

## Core Rules

### Never Invent Facts
- Do NOT make up resume details, metrics, dates, or achievements
- If a fact is missing, use `[TODO: ...]` or `[Add metric: ...]`
- Only use data from `resumeSource.md` or confirmed by the user

### Before Changing Key Decisions
- Before modifying site structure, positioning, copy voice, or tech stack:
  1. Check `decisions.md` for existing ADRs
  2. Propose the change and rationale
  3. Add a new ADR entry to `decisions.md`

### After Completing Work
- Update `activeContext.md` with current state and next steps
- Update `progress.md` (move items between Done/In Progress/Not Started)
- If a decision was made, add to `decisions.md`

### If Missing Key Information
- Ask the user targeted questions
- Write `[TODO: ...]` placeholders in the code
- Add the question to `activeContext.md` → "Open Questions for User"

### Confidential Projects (SponsorHub)
- Never expose or reference private repository code
- Focus on architecture, invariants, and engineering decisions
- Always include the confidentiality note on the SponsorHub page

### Copy and Tone
- Follow tone rules in `brandAndPositioning.md`
- No fluff words: "passionate," "motivated," "driven," "enthusiastic"
- Lead with shipped outcomes and proof, not adjectives
- Use active voice: "Built," "Designed," "Shipped"

### Code Quality
- TypeScript strict mode
- Semantic HTML (proper heading hierarchy, landmarks, ARIA)
- All interactive elements keyboard accessible
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- All colors must use CSS variable tokens (not hardcoded hex)

## Tech Stack Reference
- Next.js 14+ (App Router) + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4 (CSS-first config with `@theme inline`)
- Framer Motion (animations)
- next-themes (dark/light mode)
- lucide-react (icons)
- class-variance-authority + clsx + tailwind-merge (styling utils)
